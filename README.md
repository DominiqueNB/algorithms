## Study Plan

### Basic Concepts and Simple Data Structures
- **Arrays**
  - Example: "Two Sum", "Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits"
- **Strings**
  - Example: "Valid Anagram", "Reverse String"
- **Linked Lists**
  - Example: "Middle of the Linked List", "Reverse Linked List"
- **Review and Practice**
  - Focus on previously solved problems to reinforce concepts.

---

### Intermediate Data Structures
- **Stacks & Queues**
  - Example: "Valid Parentheses", "Implement Queue using Stacks"
- **Maps & Sets**
  - Example: "Intersection of Two Arrays", "Happy Number"
- **Simple Combinatorial Problems**
  - Example: "Climbing Stairs", "Pascal's Triangle"
- **Review and Practice**
  - Focus on previously solved problems to reinforce concepts.
